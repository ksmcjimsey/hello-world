# hello-world
First time using GitHub.  Using this repository to learn the commands.

Playing around with editing a file.

Created a branch to work on these edits.

I'm taking a coursera class on Ruby on Rails and they course is using git.  I think github will work with git for pushing the check ins off of the local computer but I'm still learning this processes.
